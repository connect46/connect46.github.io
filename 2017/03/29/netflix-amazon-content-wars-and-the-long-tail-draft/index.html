				<p>I came across <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/enemy-number-one-is-netflix-the-monster-that-s-eating-hollywood-117032600023_1.html">this article</a> about Netflix's planned massive investment in creating original content. Here's a key quote from that article to highlight the size of the investment this year - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Netflix’s spending on original and acquired programming this year is expected to be more than $6 billion, up from $5 billion last year, more than double what Time Warner Inc.’s HBO spends and five times as much as 21st Century Fox’s FX or CBS Corp.’s Showtime. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now add to that the fact that in 2016, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-spending-over-3-billion-on-video-and-music-for-prime-retention-2016-1">Amazon spent over $3 Billion on content for its music and video service</a>. Amazon doesn't quite breakout all the expenses and intended spend but <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/amazon-to-spend-more-than-100-million-on-original-series-in-q3-1201268987/">this article</a> seemed to indicate a spend in at least one quarter of 2014 of about a $100 million. I would argue that they have doubled down given that people talking about the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13282160/netflix-chris-rock-comedy-stand-up-40-million">$40 million payday for Chris Rock</a> on Netflix also need to remember Amazon's <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-says-amazon-paid-250-million-for-the-grand-tour-2016-11">$250 million bet</a> on the ex-hosts of Top Gear to produce "The Grand Tour". Amazon and Netflix have recouped a lot of their investments given the number of Emmys, Golden Globes and Oscars that shows and movies such as "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502172/awards">Mozart in the Jungle</a>", "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502262/awards">Transparent</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4034228/awards">Manchester by the Sea</a>" have won for Amazon and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Netflix">much larger number</a> for Netflix across all its shows - "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_House_of_Cards">House of Cards</a>", "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162/awards">Orange is the new Black</a>" etc. </p>

<p>To state the obvious, it looks like Amazon and Netflix are looking to really up-end the television and movie business in a significant way. Whether and how traditional Hollywood, TV companies (such as CBS, NBC etc.) or even famed content producers like HBO can compete with this, is an open and interesting question.</p>

<p>My motivation to write this is somewhat different. I wanted to understand what drove them to embark on this journey and why they felt this was something they could be successful at i.e. what was their strategy? Secondly, should we expect Google and Facebook (and others like it - Snapchat and Pinterest) to do something similar?</p>

<h2 id="changedrivesopportunity">Change drives opportunity</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where's there's change, there's opportunity</p>
  
  <p>-- Jack Welch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consumers are ultimately content driven. The more unique the content and the more targeted the content to their interests, the higher the likelihood of them spending time and money on that distributor of content. The Internet has driven a lot of change by it's very nature while at the same time offering opportunities for startups and organizations to leverage that change and create businesses via disintermediation. In the content (news, music, movies) business, this has created a potential disaster for existing content distributors while at the same time offering the opportunity for new models of satisfying consumer needs. </p>

<h3 id="opportunity1unbundling">Opportunity #1: Unbundling</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never learned to cook, but I can write a hook</p>
  
  <p>-- Meghan Trainor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newspapers performed the function of a distributor of content for decades but the advent of the Internet removed a lot of barriers of distribution. Hence we, as consumers have the ability to source easily and directly per our interests, all the various pieces of content that a newspaper aggregated and distributed. That mostly explains the hole that newspapers are in now. Newspapers have been struggling with the consequences of unbundling over the past several years. Music companies are facing some similar challenges with Spotify, iTunes, SoundCloud and more. The advantage that music distributors and creators do have is that the barrier to entry in music is much more as compared to the written word for the obvious reason that it is a lot more difficult to write, arrange and carry a tune (hence the above quote) as opposed to a so-called expert spouting off on things that they know little to nothing about. The music market is still evolving because as opposed to the written word because the individual creators (Taylor Swift, Meghan Trainor, Beyonce, JayZ etc.) are the brand and the quality of the content is mostly indisputable. </p>

<p>A lot has been written about unbundling especially in the context of cable TV. The cable TV industry has begun to respond to it with outsiders like SlingTV, PlayStation announcing plans and incumbents like AT&amp;T announcing innovative options. But at the end of the day, the innovators (apart from AT&amp;T) are not distributors i.e. they don't control the last mile. And therein lies the opportunity.</p>

<p>Amazon, Google, Netflix, Facebook and LinkedIn are very interesting in that they all took a distribution first approach. Netflix was a pioneer in the distribution space for movies. Amazon for physical products. Google for information. Facebook for curiosity about your friends' personal lives and LinkedIn for your friends' professional lives. </p>

<p>Coming back to the media aspect of the post, Netflix was the first to establish themselves as the media conduit to individual homes. We all remember when Queues were (and still are) a thing and we were happy to rate movies that we watched. This, I would argue was Netflix's hack to create a direct conduit to people's homes - DVD queues. DVD queues gave them a glimpse into preferences. When this was followed up by their announcement of direct streaming of movies in 2007, it was not a great stretch for us to sign up to that (as well or as a replacement) and that allowed them to gather much more detailed data. All this while media companies and other producers of content still relied on aggregate data, perhaps did not quite see the value of the data they had or did not know exactly how to capitalize on it without making major changes to the way they did business. </p>

<p>Once the conduit was established, Netflix through its DVD and streaming offerings, Amazon through Prime and Twitch, Google through YouTube, each of those players began the process of unbundling i.e. creating and/or allowing targeting of content to the individual consumer interests based on the data that they had on an individual level. In the media world, Netflix was the pioneer. </p>

<h3 id="opportunity2personaldata">Opportunity #2: Personal data</h3>

<p>What Netflix did differently, was to understand the value of data and its implications on personalization. In 2012, <strong>five years</strong> after that announcement, Netflix described in some detail its rationale as part of <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-beyond-5-stars.html">its blog post on improved recommendations</a> and I quote - </p>

<p>"<em>Streaming has not only changed the way our members interact with the service, but also the type of data available to use in our algorithms. For DVDs our goal is to help people fill their queue with titles to receive in the mail over the coming days and weeks; selection is distant in time from viewing, people select carefully because exchanging a DVD for another takes more than a day, and we get no feedback during viewing. For streaming members are looking for something great to watch right now; they can sample a few videos before settling on one, they can consume several in one session, and we can observe viewing statistics such as whether a video was watched fully or only partially.</em>"</p>

<p>Or in other words, they were able to refine preferences quickly leveraging a larger store of titles. They expanded that later to also have profiles for each user in a household. In essence, what Netflix was now able to do was to get the holy grail of marketing data - individual preferences.  We all have our preferences that can be described by some combination of "<em>tags</em>" -  <code>comedy</code>, <code>scifi</code>, <code>action</code>, <code>chris farley</code> and many more. Netflix now had those at a household and individual level across millions of households globally. </p>

<p>That distribution hack allowed them to obviate the need for panel data i.e. the Nielsen and other panel data that organizations pay for to understand <em>aggregate</em> market preferences. Netflix could now understand preferences <em>directly</em> on a per individual basis. It could capture that data and tailor the viewing experience with appropriate recommendations. Is it too much of a surprise that they would shortly also create content to address each of those niches that it could see weren't well served? Those niches wouldn't show up as large $100 million openings in the traditional Hollywood analysis but were a significant market in and of themselves i.e. the long tail. </p>

<p>Amazon's ecommerce business is the embodiment of the long tail. So it is not very surprising that Amazon Video was born. While they didn't have a lot of the detailed data on viewing that Netflix had, it had proxy data through the sales of DVDs and associated reviews not to mention the raw data they have through their acquisition of <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazoncom-acquires-three-leading-internet-companies-77640732.html">IMDB</a>. I'm not entirely sure why Amazon Video does not have the feedback / rating that Netflix offers but I guess there might be some patents involved. I haven't delved into the other major player in this area, namely Google. The evolution of YouTube has been an interesting progression to watch but it is now the defacto channel for content produced by and for niches. Production values might not be as great as the professionally produced ones on Netflix although that is changing and will continue to improve as YouTube Red comes into its own. Similarly TwitchTV (now part of Amazon) and YouTube's gaming channels cater to a different and highly profitable niche. An example of the value of a niche in the gaming world is easily illustrated by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry">Geek and Sundry's Twitch</a> channel, which has had most of its success thanks to a live stream of D&amp;D called <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/">Critical Role</a>. In about 2 years, they've grown to about 35,000 paying subscribers each paying $5 per month or $2,000,000 per year!</p>

<p>In any case, the two capabilities I described earlier - a conduit to homes and a knowledge of the preferences of each member of the household allows Netflix and increasingly Amazon and Google to broadcast to niches at minimal extra cost. That in essence is the <a href="http://www.longtail.com/about.html">Long Tail theory</a> i.e. as long as distribution costs are a non-issue, niches can be very profitable.</p>

<h2 id="quovadimus">Quo vadimus?</h2>

<p>It is interesting to think about how this industry will evolve. The two criteria I use to think through this are the two I mentioned just earlier - Directness of the conduit and individual preference data. </p>

<p>Here's a quick graphic illustrating that with the caveat that it is not comprehensive and I'm using a few key players to illustrate the strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/q2n4k0j0mr2vspn/content.2x2.png?dl=0" alt="Content strategy 2x2" /></p>

<p>Netflix, Amazon and Google are obviously in the top right hand quadrant as they all have the conduit as well as the detailed data on users. </p>

<h3 id="cablecompanies">Cable companies</h3>

<p>The challenge facing the cable companies (Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T) is that they have the conduit but limited access to user preferences. The latter is not because they couldn't get that data but rather they didn't. Which means they're starting from scratch now. However, given that they still have that conduit in place, they can catch up quickly if they so choose. They realize this now and hence are making moves in that direction (the most public of those strategies has been AT&amp;T's recent announcements surrounding its DirectTV service) and surely more data gathering as part of their services. They are however still limited by the fact that the conduit advantage they have here in the US does not extend to the rest of the world. Add to that the fact that they still do not have a coherent strategy around content creation and strategists at those organizations have a challenge on their hands. </p>

<p><strong>So what they likely to do?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buy content organizations</strong>: More purchases like Comcast's purchase of Universal but more focused on content integration rather than a balance sheet / investment orientation.</li>
<li><strong>Start their own content arms</strong>: This is possible but unlikely as they are just not setup for it</li>
<li><strong>Focus on distribution but global</strong>: Continue to be the distribution / conduit but do so globally. This is delaying addressing the problem for a later time but has its own advantages. So expect them to buy locally focused distribution in other parts of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Offer specific channels with content sourced from Netflix, Amazon and others</strong>: Why not? If you can't beat them, join them or at least partner with them. Amazon and Netflix might not want to do so but similar to the backlog model that started Netflix off, maybe we can expect to see Season 1 of House of Cards on Comcast. They both could benefit from it - Netflix by opening up an additional revenue stream and a source of potential subscribers and the cable companies double dipping into the conduits they have in place.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broadcastchannels">Broadcast channels</h3>

<p>CBS, NBC and HBO (as a proxy for traditional TV channels) have a bit more of an uphill battle here. They do not have the direct conduit and by the nature of their business model i.e. linear TV, the brand associated with content belongs to the shows or in other words, more people prefer the show over the channel that it ran on. They realized this of course which is what led to partnerships with the likes of Hulu and more recently, taking the lead from HBO, the launch of their own channels available through Roku, Amazon Prime and direct at an additional subscription price. This seems to be an attempt to copy the paywall approach taken somewhat successfully by news organizations, It seems doomed because of the reasons I mentioned earlier - content they broadcast has its own brand, they have no conduit to the consumers nor do they have any data about their users. </p>

<p><strong>So what they likely to do?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use Netflix, Amazon and others as content channels in addition to traditional TV</strong>: A CBS branded show on Netflix? Again, why not up-end the traditional model and see how it works. Not to mention the ability for CBS and others to reset consumer expectations around paying for content generated/paid for by traditionally "free" channels.</li>
<li><strong>Begin branding their own content</strong> - This has to happen otherwise they are doomed. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="facebookandgoogleandmaybesnapchat">Facebook and Google (and maybe Snapchat)</h3>

<p>Excepting Google, the one other company which has the conduit as well as detailed preference data is Facebook and its sheer scale dwarfs the others. Snapchat is a smaller player snapping at their heels but it seems to have a better handle on future consumer trends. </p>

<p>Facebook know a lot about individual preferences and has invested a lot of time and effort in creating that direct conduit to people's homes. I would posit that we should expect to see Facebook Video (or some better branded version thereof) soon. Similarly from Snapchat. Essentially, expect these two things from these players:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook Video (and a similar variant from Snapchat)</li>
<li>A new form of content tailored to their consumer profiles.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tailored form of content is likely to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Short (5-15 min) bursts</li>
<li>Well produced</li>
<li>Mobile focused</li>
<li>Strong but personalized story lines</li>
<li>Binge-able i.e. 10 episodes of 10-15 mins each all released in one go similar to Netflix.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that Google has both the conduit and preference data, its move into paid programming aka YouTube Red, was to be expected. What is unclear is how that translates to traditional TV. Cord cutting is a thing for sure but we all need to understand that cord-cutters are <strong>not</strong> the majority. That has to be factor for organizations such as Google where the US is just one market. </p>

<p>If Facebook and Google take the long view, then this is an opportunity for them to redefine what TV is. I would argue they should focus on that especially in non-US markets.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'll leave you with that for now. I have some more details and thoughts re how Hollywood should / could react to all this but I'll leave that for a future post.</p>
